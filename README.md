# Wordle
## Description
This is designed to be a wordle app that can be used to practice for the real wordle. It was written in Java using JavaFX as the graphics. It is not currently published anywhere but was just a fun project to make for my portfolio. This was built from scratch except the word lists that I pulled from Wordle source code.
This contains complete list of wordle guess words and a seprate list for the possible answer words.
